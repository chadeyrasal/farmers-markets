# Farmers Markets in the UK

Welcome to the Farmers Markets UK CLI application. This application allows the user to get a list of all farmers markets in the UK as listed by the FARMA - National Farmers' Retail and Markets Association. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'farmers-markets'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

------

To be checked. I believe this requires the creation of a gem specific to the application on ruby-gems.com
Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install farmers-markets
    
------

## Usage

To use the Farmers Markets UK CLI application you need to type 'farmers-markets' in your terminal and press enter. Once the application is launched you will simply need to follow the prompts on the screen. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
